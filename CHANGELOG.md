# Changelog

## [2.1.0] — 2026-03-03

### ✨ Reactive N/M▸ tool counter

- Counter now shows `N/M▸` during tool execution (e.g., `2/4▸`)
- **Predicted total seeded from history** — immediately shows realistic M value based on avgSteps from past runs
- **Reactive growth** — if actual tools exceed prediction, counter grows in real-time (`4/4▸ → 5/5▸ → 6/6▸`)
- Works across all models (Claude, GLM, GPT)

### ✨ Model version in output

- `shortModel()` now extracts full version: `glm-5`, `glm-4.7`, `opus-4.6`, `sonnet-4.6`
- No more generic "glm" — you see exactly which variant

## [2.0.0] — 2026-03-03

**Complete v2.0 refactor** — thinking/sending phases, per-tool ETA, real tool count.

### ✨ New phases

- **`thinking`** — AI reasoning pass (no visible output, just internal thought)
- **`sending`** — Agent done, waiting for message delivery
- Phase transitions trigger urgent flush for immediate UI feedback

### ✨ Per-tool ETA

- Each tool tracks its own average duration
- ETA adjusts based on which tool is running (exec takes longer than Read)
- Historical data stored per tool in preferences

### ✨ Real tool counter

- Parses `llm_output` for `tool_use` blocks to predict total steps
- Shows `N/M▸` during execution when prediction available
- Falls back to `N▸` when no prediction

### 🔴 Critical fixes

- **#24** — Adaptive thinking double-cycle (memoryFlush embedded Pi agent)
- **#25** — `maxRunTimer` safety net (60s)
- **#26** — memoryFlush causing double status bar cycle → **disabled by default**
- **isEditNotFound** — SDK path wraps errors without HTTP code, breaking detection
- **cleanupStaleMessages** — now clears stale ref from store on "message to edit not found"
- **sending stuck** — removed `"sending"` from `ACTIVE_PHASES`, 2s timer is sole mechanism

### 🧹 Cleanup

- Removed `message_sending`/`message_sent` hooks (don't fire for main AI replies)
- `bestEffort` delivery mode for graceful degradation
- Consolidated hook handlers, cleaner state machine

## [1.1.0] — 2026-02-25

### ✨ Inline buttons

Interactive buttons below the status bar — no need to type commands:

- **During execution:** `[ 📊 mode ] [ 📌 Pin/Unpin ] [ ⏹ Off ]`
- **On completion:** `[ 📊 mode ] [ 🔄 Reset ] [ ⏹ Off ]`
- Mode button cycles: minimal → normal → detailed → minimal
- Toggle with `/sbbuttons` (on/off per chat)
- Buttons leverage Telegram's native callback_query — processed as commands by OpenClaw

## [1.0.0] — 2026-02-25

**First stable release.** 🎉

### ✨ Per-tool icons

Every tool now has a unique emoji — you always know what the agent is doing at a glance:

🖥 exec · 📖 Read · ✏️ Write · 🔏 Edit · ⏱️ process · 🔍 web_search · 🌐 web_fetch/browser · 💬 message · 🔌 gateway · 🎨 canvas · 🔗 nodes · ⏰ cron · 🧬 sessions_spawn · 📤 sessions_send · 🤖 subagents · 📋 session_status · 🖼 image · 🧠 memory_search/memory_get · 🔊 tts

Phase icons: 🔜 queued · 💭 thinking · 🟢 done · ❌ error

### ✨ Adaptive ETA (v3 — predicted end time)

- Calculates predicted end timestamp from step rate
- Smooth countdown between tool calls
- Auto-bumps forward when estimate is exceeded (ETA never shows 0 during active runs)
- Gets more accurate over time with historical data

### ✨ Three display modes

- **minimal** — `💭 thinking │ 00:15`
- **normal** — `🖥 exec │ ████░░░ 52% │ 00:15→13s`
- **detailed** *(default)* — full info with model, thinking level, tokens

### ✨ Mobile-optimized layout

- Progress bar 7 chars (fits Telegram pin bar)
- Compact token display: `1.5k↑340↓`
- Model + thinking inline: `opus-4.6|High`

### 🔴 Fixes since 0.2.0

- **#22** — renderTimer not cancelled on urgent flush
- **#23** — accountId mismatch between hooks (queued vs running)

## [0.2.0] — 2026-02-19

### 🔴 Critical fixes

- **#1 — Memory leak `sessions` Map**
  Sessions removed after 2h inactivity via `cleanupSessions()`.

- **#2 — No plugin teardown**
  Added `destroy()` method — stops `liveTicker`, cancels all timers, clears session map. Supports hot-reload.

- **#3 — Race condition on `persist()`**
  Writes serialized via promise chain (`persistQueue`). No more concurrent file corruption.

- **#4 — No `fetch()` timeout**
  Every Telegram API call uses `AbortController` with configurable timeout (10s edit, 15s send/pin).

- **#5 — `editStatusMessage` swallowed real error codes**
  Original error code now preserved. 429s from SDK path correctly detected by circuit breaker. Textual heuristic fallback for unstructured errors.

- **#17 — No global circuit breaker**
  Added `GlobalRateLimiter` in transport. When a 429 is received, all requests to `(accountId, chatId)` are blocked for `retry_after` duration.

- **#18 — Default throttle too aggressive (caused 429 bans)**
  | Param | Before | After |
  |---|---|---|
  | `throttleMs` | 1200ms | 4000ms |
  | `minThrottleMs` | 900ms | 2500ms |
  | `liveTickMs` | 1000ms | 2500ms |

- **#19 — No fetch timeout guard in circuit breaker check**
  `flushSession` now checks circuit breaker before every API call.

- **#20 — Phase transition didn't bypass throttle**
  Phase changes now trigger urgent flush (bypass throttle) for immediate UI feedback.

- **#21 — `sendMessage` had 0 retries same as ephemeral edits**
  `maxRetriesSend` defaults to 4. Critical operations (send/pin) retry; edits don't.
